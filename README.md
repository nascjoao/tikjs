_Tik.js is under development_

> If you want to handle dates like parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting, you should use [day.js](https://day.js.org/). It is a fast 2kB alternative to Moment.js with the same modern API.
>
> Tik.js is a lightweight library for formatting time only. It is choice for those who do not want to add an extra size to their project.

```js
import tikjs from "tikjs";

tikjs(600).format("Ti[m]e: mm:ss"); // Time: 10:00
```
